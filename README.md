Demo Banking Dekstop Application
A banking application i made in my internship in Halkbank. Users can create account and card information and bind these information together. I have MongoDB for
database even though NoSQL databases are not meant to be used in banking because of their structure. So this application is completely experimental and not meant to be
used in a real-life scenario.
